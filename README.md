## Quiz 9
### Part 1: Imaging Technique Inspiration

I was inspired by the Matrix sequence that zooms in, distorts and transforms on-screen figures into green ripple tunnels, and the sequence that shows the trajectory of a bullet through bullet time and slow motion. Both of these images show very surreal and sci-fi worlds in 1999 through visual effects such as object-to-object warping, slow-motion, waveform distortion and ghosting. I plan to use similar waveform lines and warping operations on graphics in my assignments. This technique will be used to alter the image to echo the theme set by our group.
